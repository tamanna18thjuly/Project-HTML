                The Taj Mahal, a spectacle in white marble, unparalleled in grandeur that 
                depicts the sheer opulence of an era. The awesome structure, the monument 
                of love that Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan gave to the world, stands as a 
                testimony of his intense love for his wife Mumtaz Mahal.Tourists from 
                all over the world visit Agra to make a pilgrimage to Taj Mahal, India’s 
                most famous architectural wonder, in a land where magnificent temples 
                and edifices abound to remind visitors about the rich civilization 
                of a country that is slowly but surely lifting itself into an 
                industrialized society as well.Taj Mahal stands on the bank of River Yamuna, 
                which otherwise serves as a wide most defending the Great Red Fort of Agra, 
                the center of the Mughal emperors until they moved their capital to Delhi 
                in 1637. It was built by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan in 1631 in 
                memory of his third but the most favourite wife, in fact a soul-mate Mumtaz 
                Mahal, a Muslim Persian princess. She died while accompanying her husband in 
                Burhanpur in a campaign to crush a rebellion after giving birth to their 13th 
                child. The death so crushed the emperor that all his hair and beard were said
                 to have grown snow white in a few months.

            Chichén Itzá, ruined ancient Maya city occupying an area of 4 square miles 
            (10 square km) in south-central Yucatán state, Mexico. Chichen Itza was founded by
            the Maya, an ancient people native to the Yucatan Peninsula. Historians believe 
            that Chichen Itza was built due to its close proximity to the Xtoloc cenote. 
            Chichen Itza was founded by the Maya, an ancient people inhabiting the Yucutan 
            peninsula.Roughly all sources agree that from approximately 550 AD to 800 AD, 
            Chichen Itza existed mainly as a ceremonial center for the Maya civilization. 
            The area was then largely abandoned for about a hundred years (no one knows reason),
            to be resettled around 900 AD again.Historic accounts differ as to when Chichen 
            Itza was built and ultimately developed into a center of political and economic 
            power. Some accounts place the establishment of the city in the early 400s A.D.,
            while others suggest construction started a few years later, in the middle part 
            of the fifth century.
