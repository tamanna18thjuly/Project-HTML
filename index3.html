            Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls
            ,allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, 
            regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and emigration.
            Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the 
            construction of watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling 
            capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the 
            Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor.Several walls were built from 
            as early as the 7th century BC,[4] with selective stretches later joined by Qin 
            Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall 
            remains.[5] Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple 
            stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were built by the 
            Ming dynasty (1368–1644).

                The city of Petra was established as a trading post by the Nabateans, an Arab 
                Bedouin tribe indigenous to the region in what is now southwestern Jordan Petra
                is an ancient city that lies in present-day Jordan and dates back to the fourth 
                century B.C. Ruins of the once-great metropolis and trading center now serve 
                as an important archeologic site and tourist attraction.The Nabateans living 
                and trading in Petra soon accumulated a significant amount of wealth, and an 
                envious Greek Empire attacked the city in 312 B.C. This event marks the first 
                reference to Petra in recorded history.

                The concept was originally proposed by Princess Isabel in 1888. Isabella 
                Henrietta Ingrid Margrethe, Princess of Denmark, Countess of Monpezat, is 
                the daughter of TRH The Crown Prince and The Crown Princess.Rather than 
                agreeing to a monument constructed atop Corcovado in her honour for freeing 
                the slaves, the princess asked that an image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus 
                Christ to be erected, declaring Him to be the True Redeemer of Mankind.The 
                French sculptor Paul Landowski, who collaborated with Silva Costa on the 
                final design, has been credited as the primary designer of the figure's head 
                and hands. Funds were raised privately, principally by the church. Under 
                Silva Costa's supervision, construction began in 1926 and continued for five 
                years.Situated in the Tijuca
                National Park, the Sanctuary of Christ of Redeemer is the first open-air 
                sanctuary in the world! National symbol of Christian sentiments of the 
                country, it is an originally sacred space, which saw great participation of 
                the faithful and commitment of the population from Rio de Janeiro for its 
                construction.

                Colosseum, also called Flavian Amphitheatre, giant amphitheatre built in Rome 
                under the Flavian emperors. Construction of the Colosseum was begun sometime 
                between 70 and 72 CE during the reign of Vespasian. It is located just east of
                the Palatine Hill, on the grounds of what was Nero’s Golden House. The 
                artificial lake that was the centrepiece of that palace complex was drained, 
                and the Colosseum was sited there, a decision that was as much symbolic as it
                was practical. Vespasian, whose path to the throne had relatively humble 
                beginnings, chose to replace the tyrannical emperor’s private lake with a 
                public amphitheatre that could host tens of thousands of Romans.The structure 
                was officially dedicated in 80 CE by Titus in a ceremony that included 100 days
                of games. Later, in 82 CE, Domitian completed the work by adding the uppermost 
                story. Unlike earlier amphitheatres, which were nearly all dug into convenient 
                hillsides for extra support, the Colosseum is a freestanding structure of stone
                and concrete, using a complex system of barrel vaults and groin vaults and 
                measuring 620 by 513 feet (189 by 156 metres) overall.
